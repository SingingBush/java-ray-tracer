Simple Java Ray Tracer
======================

In 2012 I stumbled upon a blog post by [Barak Cohen](https://plus.google.com/109999908224705846661/posts) titled 'Ray Tracing: A Simple Java, Open Source Implementation'.

It was posted back in 2008 and provided an attached Eclipse project written by Barak Cohen and Gur Dotan.

I have updated the project structure to build using Gradle. Unfortunately the original authors chose to use swt for the gui so builds will have to be platform specific.
